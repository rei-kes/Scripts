notes:

* Intended to be used with Synapse V3 because of it's drawing library

* Currently only a projectile aimbot demo
    * Was going to implement more features, but seeing as Synapse is now dead I don't see a use
    * Seems to be some issues with raycasting where it will phase through geometry
    * Lackluster implementation of Demo's weapons

* Don't use this on any accounts you care about, there may be new detections I am not aware about

* Crackhead code, etc. etc.
