```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rei-kes/Scripts/main/TypicalColors2/Main.lua"))()
```

notes:

  currently only 1 feature, projectile aimbot
    projectile aimbot iffy currently, works best with direct hit
    not all of the projectile data is used yet (and offsets seem somewhat wrong?)

  recoding the rest, slowly, eventually

  etc etc
